# cosmos-toolbox
A collection of GUIs and scripts for Co-Localization Single Molecule Spectroscopy (CoSMoS) analysis. This project is under frequent development so check back soon!

The premise of this project is inspired by and adapted from https://github.com/marcel-goldschen-ohm/single-molecule-imaging-toolbox by Dr. Marcel Goldschen-Ohm. This project aims to advance the functionality single-molecule-imaging-toolbox, including: 
* Support of multiple file types, including .tif, .ome.tif (MicroManager) and .glimpse
* Automatic image processing, including channel alignment, AOI detection, and drift correction.
* Inclusion of multiple time series analysis algorithms, including DISC, SKM, change-point detection, and vbFRET for semi-automated analysis. 
* Inclusion of "image galleries" for direct visualizations of AOIs to confirm on target binders. 
* A large collection of scripts for data analysis and visualization, including dwell time analysis via maximum likelihood.
* Publication ready plots
* Export to other file formats, including QuB
